# HunterMarketApp-Frontend
This is a frontend part of one of my projects, called HunterMarketApp. The app simulates a e-commerce service, with users profiles and their informations, list of products with photos, description and price, discounts, categories and etc.

I did not create functions to purchase products, just a simulation.

<li>The login screen and services to create a new profile and other screen to change password.</li>

<li>After you login in the app, you will see the categories available on the app, like this screen:</i>

And a lot of other's screens that i'd created. The app is hospedated in heroku, then if in the login or cadaster delay, is because of heroku's cooldown. 

If you wanna try the app, download it here: https://mega.nz/file/yRxlRDAZ.
